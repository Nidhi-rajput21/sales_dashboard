E-commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI)
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing e-commerce sales data. The dashboard tracks sales, profit, AOV, and quantity, with filters for quarter and state-level insights. Visualizations include profit by month, sales by customer, payment modes, and product categories, helping uncover key business trends and customer patterns.
